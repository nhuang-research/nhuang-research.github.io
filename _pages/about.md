I am a Professor of Business Technology, Miami Herbert Centennial Endowed Chair, and Associate Dean for Research at the [Miami Herbert Business School](https://www.herbert.miami.edu/), `University of Miami`. Previously, I was the C. T. Bauer Professor of Artificial Intelligence & Digital Society and Director of the Bauer College PhD Programs in the C. T. Bauer College of Business at University of Houston and a faculty advisory member of the HPE Data Science Institute. Prior to that, I was a tenured faculty member at Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business. I currently serve as a Senior Editor of [Production and Operations Management](http://www.poms.org/journal/departments/) and an Associate Editor at [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/isre/editorial-board). I am also currently co-editing a POM Special Issue on [Social Technologies in Operations](https://www.poms.org/POM%20Social%20Technology%20special%20issue.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0SfajVeeNq7pfh6EhVHaLL_vQGGrxnRUtCdMI88j8P5_EgCV7APrGTVWM).

My research interests are in the areas of `Future of Work`, `Digital Platforms`, `Digital Media`, and `Human-Algorithm Interactions`. My research has been published in premier journals such as `Management Science`, `Information Systems Research`, `MIS Quarterly`, `Production and Operations Management`, `INFORMS Journal on Computing`, among others. My work has been supported by several prestigious grants, from the `Robert Wood Johnson Foundation`, the `National Science Foundation`, `NET Institute`, and the `Department of Education`.

My research papers have won a number of best paper awards at major conferences, including the `Workshop on Information Systems and Economics` (2018), the `International Conference on Information Systems` (2012, 2018, 2020, 2021), `Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences` (2017), `INFORMS Annual Conference Information Systems Cluster` (2024), `INFORMS Annual Conference eBusiness Cluster` (2021), `America's Conference on Information Systems` (2012), and the `China Summer Workshop on Information Management` (2018). My dissertation research on the gig economy and future of work was awarded the `ACM SIGMIS Best Dissertation Award` and runner-up `INFORMS ISS Nunamaker-Chen Dissertation Award`. In 2017, I was awarded the college-wide `W. P. Carey Faculty Research Award`. Further, I was awarded the `Association for Information Systems Early Career Award` (2018) and the `INFORMS Information Systems Society Sandy Slaughter Early Career Award` (2019). And I was awarded the `Associate Editor of the Year Award` (2018) from `Information Systems Research`. According to the [AIS Research Rankings](https://www.aisresearchrankings.org/rankings/), I was ranked #5 in the world based on publications in the top two information systems journals (*MISQ*, *ISR*) for 2021-2023 and #7 for 2016-2018. And I received the Outstanding PhD Alumni Award (2020) from the Fox School of Business, Temple University. And I am an AIS Distinguished Member since 2020.

At Miami Herbert Business School, I have taught at executive, PhD, masters, and undergraduate levels. At Bauer College, I led the `Bauer Initiative in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Society`. I also led the effort in designing and delivering the `Business Data Analytics Mini-MBA Executive Education Program`. Prior to joining the Bauer College at UH, I worked at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University (ASU) as an Assistant Professor (2014-2018) and tenured Associate Professor (2018-2020), where I was also the director of the IS PhD program, co-director of the Digital Society Initiative, and the Nita & Phil Francis Faculty Fellow. I have taught and led the curriculum development at both the undergraduate (`Computer Information Systems` (CIS) and `Business Data Analytics` (BDA)) and graduate (MSBA and PhD) levels. Most notably, I led the college-level initiatives in designing and implementing the undergraduate analytics core course -- `Problem Solving and Actionable Analytics` (WPC300). Serving as the course coordinator for WPC300, I oversaw over 50 sections of the course each year taught by instructors from multiple departments. Further, I led a team of analytics faculty in designing, implementing, and coordinating the core college analytics course in the `online` and `hybrid` (onsite + online) formats. Here is a [live stream recording](https://player.theplatform.com/p/U8-EDC/dKzF6F2_w14a/select/media/dCsGzS1z_uCq?form=html) of my talk on analytics teaching and research in the W. P. Carey 'Back-to-Class' Alumni event in April 2019. I received Department of Information Systems' Outstanding Teaching Award in 2016, and was a finalist for the W. P. Carey Huizingh Undergraduate Teaching Award (2019), Huizingh Award for Undergraduate Service to Students (2020), and the ASU Outstanding Doctoral Mentor (2020).

Prior to my academic career, I have worked as an analyst at a leading investment bank and as a language specialist for the International Olympics Committee. Besides research and teaching as a faculty member, I serve as an advisor or external research scientist for a number of tech companies, primarily working with them on large-scale digital transformation, data analytics, and digital experimentation efforts. Some of my corporate research partners include Freelancer, Alibaba, Livad, fits.me, Summer, Ports America, Extole, Ookong, and Picmonic.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books and writing codes. I am an avid [Emacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) user, a [typography](https://fontsinuse.com/) enthusiast, a frequent [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/), and a [mechanical keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) designer and collector.
